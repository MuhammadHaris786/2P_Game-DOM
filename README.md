!!!How Game Works!!!


    Press dice button to make temporary scores and if dice with "1" value come all your temporary score 
    would be lost so Press "hold button" as soon as you think that dice with "1" value is coming so 
    that your temporary scores would be added to your real scores and whoever got "100 or more than
    100" real scores first, he  wins the game
