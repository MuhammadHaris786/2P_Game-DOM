!!!How Game Works!!!


    Press dice button to make temporary scores and if dice with "1" value come all your temporary score would be lost so Press
    "hold button" as soon as you think that dice with "1" value is coming so that your temporary scores would be added to your
    real scores and whoever got "100 or more than 100" real scores first, he  wins the game
